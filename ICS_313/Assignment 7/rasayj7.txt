2.(25 pt) Calculate how many solutions there are to the above problems mathematically, if:
 	1.balls with the same color are indistinguishable,or
        2.all balls are distinct.

Situation#1
1.-Indistinguishable
If the balls with the same color are indistinguishable
there are:
 
3*2 = 6 solutions. 

You have 2 choices of choosing which will appear
first which is blue or green. Then there are three ways of moving the
yellow around, which is after the blue and yellow balls or between
the pairs or before them.

2.Distinct
If the balls with the same color are distinc then there are:

2*3*2*2 = 24 solutions.

There are 2 ways of choosing which goes first blue or green. 3 ways of 
to place the yellow ball. 2 ways of choosing which of the green ball
goes first. Then 2 ways of choosing which of the blue ball goes first.

Situation#2
1.Indistinguishable
If the balls with the same color are indistinguishable there are:

2*1 = 2 solutions.

Since there are just two colors white and black, there is 2 ways of
placing the white ball which is before three consecutive black colored balls
or after. Then there is only black to choose from in placing first.

2.Distinct
If the balls with the same color are distinct then there are:

5*4*3*2*1*2 = 240 solutions.
(5!)*2

There are 5! ways of arranging the black colored ball and there are 2 ways of arranging the
white colored ball.

Situation#3
1.Indistinguishable
If the balls with the same color are indistinguishable there are:

3!/2! = 3 solutions.

Since the only thing your are moving are the black and white balls, then there are 3 of them
2 white and 1 black and
Total number of elements: 3!
White = 2!
Black = 1!


2.Distinct
If the balls with the same color are distinct there are:

3!*2!*3! = 72 solutions.

There 3! ways of choosing 3 green balls to go first, 2! ways of choosing 2 red balls to go first, and there
are 3! ways for arranging the black and white balls.
