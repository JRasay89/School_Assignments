display "Enter the size of the array being created”
store the size in n
while n < 1
          display “You cannot make an array of that size. Try again”
          accept n
create a new array of int with n cells, store in a
loop for i going from 0 to  a.length 
      store random numbers between 1 - 1000 in a[i]
 store y in answer
loop for I going from 0 to a.length -1
     loop while answer equals yes
          Display “Enter a number to be search”
          Store number in search
           If a[i] equals search
                 Display “That number is in cell,” i
                 Display “Would you like to search another number?”
            else
                  Display “That number is not in any cell. Try again?
