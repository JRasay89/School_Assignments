Create a new stack of Strings called theStack
Create new stringtokenizer called tokens
creat an empty string called post
store 0 in opercount
store 0 in opercount2
loop while tokens has more tokens
   store next tokens in token
   store char at 0 of token in op
   if op = operator
      increment opercount
      push in theStack
      push string "off" in theStack
   else if op = operand
      increment opercount2
      if the stack is empty
         throw exception "invalid expression"
      else
         put the operand in the string post
      while theStack is not empty and top of theStack is the string "on"
         pop "On" from theStack
         pop theStack store in operator
         put operator in the string post
      if theStack is not empty
          pop theStack
          push the string "on" in theStack
   else
      throw exception "invalid operator"
if opercount  >= opercount2
  throw exception "Invalid expression"
loop while theStack is not empty
   if the top of theStack is the string "on" or "off"
      pop theStack
   else
      pop theStack and store in operator
      put the operator in the string post
return post
