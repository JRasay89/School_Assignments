Why is the 1st arrived process treated better in the Preemptive algorithm?

	-The first arrived process is treated better in the Preemptive because it 
 arrived first and so it 
         preempts all other process whenever its ready.






When can the 2nd arrived process run in the Non-Preemptive case?

	-In a Non-Preemptive case the 2nd arrived process runs after the first arrived process 
 finish its cpu burst.
