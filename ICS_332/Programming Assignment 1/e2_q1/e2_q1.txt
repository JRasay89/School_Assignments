Exercise 2:

Question #1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the command-lione i use the command

strace -xf -e trace=read -otracefile_cp cp example ~/Downloads/ex

I filtered the output to only get the system call read

Output:
This is the output that i look at
2209  read(3, "hello\n\n", 32768)       = 7

looking at the man page for read,I think the third argument is the the number of bytes to be put
into the buffer, so I think the buffer size used is 32768kb.
