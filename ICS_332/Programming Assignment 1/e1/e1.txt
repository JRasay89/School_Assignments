Exercise 1:
With this exercise i use the command

strace -xfc -otracefile_java java Noop
and
strace -xfc -otracefile_c ./Noop

I added the option -c to get the number of calls and how many times they were called 

Questions:
1. Noop.java = 7351 Total System calls
   Noop.c = 24 Total System calls

2. Noop.java = 45 Unique System Calls
   Noop.c = 11 Unique System calls

3. 
These systems calls were used by the java program:
   clone - I think this call just creates a child process
   gettimeofday - I think this call just gets the timezone
   openat - and this call just opens some directory
