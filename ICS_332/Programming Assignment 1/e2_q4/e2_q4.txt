Question #4
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Command-line used:

This is the commands that I used. I wasn't able to learn how to get everything in 1 big command so I had to do each of
them seperately.

-I first use this command to open banshee and output the system call open() to a file.
strace -xf -e trace=open -otracefile_banshee banshee

-Then from the output file I used grep to remove the lines with (No such file or directory) which
 I think are the failed attempts and save it to different ouput.
grep -v '(No such file or directory)' tracefile_banshee >> output1.txt

-Then from that outputfile I used grep again to only get the lines with lib and save it to another outputfile.
grep 'lib' output1.txt >> output2.txt

-Then from that outputfile I used grep to only get the lines with .so. and save it to another outputfile
grep '.so.' output2.txt >> output3.txt

-I then sorted the last output file and remove the duplicates and save it to a different outputfile.
sort output3.txt | uniq >> output4.txt

-Then I used this command to read the number of lines to get the number of shared libraries used from output4.
sed -n '$=' output4.txt


Number of Shared Libraries:
118
